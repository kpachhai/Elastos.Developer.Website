## Trinity CLI

Trinity CLI is a command line tool that helps you manage your trinity applications, including creating a new application, running during development, and publishing.

### Dependencies

- A MacOS or Linux operating system
- Python
- Android adb (to test on Android devices)
- Ionic
- Node v10 (not v12)
- Trinity app (APK) installed on android (to be able to deploy development EPKs)

$ npm install -g @elastosfoundation/trinity-cli
{{< /highlight >}}

### Getting help
