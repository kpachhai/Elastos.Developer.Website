## Environment setup

Make sure to first {{< internallink "setup your computer for trinity" "elastos_trinity/setup/environment_setup.md" >}}.

## Creating a new app

Open a terminal at the location you want your application to be created. A subfolder will be created for you. Then run the following command

```bash
$ trinity-cli new
```

Provide a few information such as your app name, package name, author information, and a new folder will be created with your DApp.

The created application uses the ionic framework. It simply embeds an additional *manifest.json* file to be considered as a trinity application.

## Converting an existing ionic app to a trinity DApp

In case you already have a ionic application, and would like to run it inside trinity, you have to generate a trinity manifest to make it become compatible. 

Enter your ionic app's folder then run the following command:

```bash
$ trinity-cli manifest
```

### Learning Ionic

For more detail about Ionic, please visit [here](https://ionicframework.com/docs/).
You can build any kind of ionic-based application in Elastos, as the whole ionic framework is available. In addition, Elastos plugins are available too, such as carrier, hive, or access to payments and digital identities (DID).

### Running your DApp on Android

**Checklist:**

- Trinity must be installed on your device
- Connect your device to your computer using a USB cable.
- Make sure android adb is in your path.

Enter your app's folder in a terminal then run the following command:

```bash
$ trinity-cli run -p android
```

That will package your application as a EPK file, send it to your device, install it inside Trinity, and run it.

### Developping your DApp

After your app is launched inside trinity, you can directly edit your app content from its src/ folder. Changes will automatically reload in trinity.

### Trinity DApps manifest

A *manifest.json* file is created by default in your trinity DApp project. You can manually edit it whenever needed. The Trinity manifest format is fully described in the {{< internallink "trinity manifest guide" "elastos_trinity/guides/trinity_manifest.md" >}}.
