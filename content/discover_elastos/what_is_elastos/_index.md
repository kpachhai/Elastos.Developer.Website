Elastos solves the trilemma of all blockchain projects out there - the problem of **security** using the trusted runtime environment, **scalability** using the main chain sidechains solutions and **decentralization** using the peer to peer network.

Elastos is **the safe and reliable internet of the future**. Built utilizing the blockchain, this technological breakthrough provides **the first completely safe environment** on the web where **decentralized applications are detached from the internet** while also permitting full scalability to billions of users. Elastos enables the generation of wealth through ownership and exchange of your data and digital assets.

Elastos is not a blockchain project but rather a **network operating system** project powered by blockchain technology so in that sense, Elastos is not directly competing with any other blockchain projects. It can work together with them to form this new ecosystem where the decentralized applications run directly on the device instead of running on the blockchain along with **decentralized peer to peer network** to transfer assets in a completely closed **sandboxed environment**, thereby solving the trilemma of blockchain projects - security, scalability, and decentralization.

Inside **Trinity**, Elastos uses internet as the base-layer infrastructure and decentralized applications are forced to never directly connect to the internet and only interact with Elastos runtime(which in turn acts as a middle layer, then connecting to the internet). Within the elastos ecosystem, everything from devices to virtual machines to users to DApps have a DID(Decentralized ID) issued by the blockchain and everytime the application requests any sort of internet access, the ID has to first be verified using the blockchain which in turn eliminates many of the man-in-the-middle attacks, virus attacks, etc.

### Trustable Sidechains
Elastos gets its hashpower from Bitcoin and some of the largest mining pools in the world including Bitmain, this secures the ELA token which is also used for DPoS node voting. By distributing load across multiple sidechains and replacing expensive PoW consensus in major blockchains like Ethereum with DPoS, Elastos is able to achieve far greater performance while maintaining a secure trustless environment.

### Key Features Include
* Intuitive APIs, a 500-1500+ TPS Ethereum sidechain and a wide variety of useful services.
* Cyber Republic, one of the first decentralized community governance models to trial on-chain governance, control over allocation of funds and council elections open to everybody.
* Developers have a say in how the platform evolves, so even if there is some lock-in to Elastos there is a pathway to adapt it to best suit the community
* Funding for startups, projects and frameworks through the Cyber Republic Consensus (CRC). Find out more by visiting us at [https://www.cyberrepublic.org](https://www.cyberrepublic.org)
