The following guides give you bases to start implementing Elastos concepts in your apps. Provided code snippets are not directly runnable, but point to the most important API calls you need to get things run.

For example, you can discover how to let users {{< internallink "purchase a digital item using ELA" "payments.md" >}}, {{< internallink "get user profile information" "digital_identities.md" >}}, {{< internallink "store and retrieve files" "data_storage.md" >}}, {{< internallink "write and run ethereum smart contracts" "ethereum_smart_contracts.md" >}}, and much more.
